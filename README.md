# mc
mc is a minetest modpack for the game MineClone2. The goal is to turn it into Minecraft 1.16.

# Installing
Download the latest *minor* version (I only test myself and fix all bugs before I release a minor version), unzip it, copy it to the mods folder, and rename the folder to ```mc```. Then, enable the modpack in the chosen world.

# Code, Textures and Models

I often need code, textures, and models to complete things. I greatly appreciate these contributions.

## Code

I'm not *too* picky about code, but if the code is extremly messy, i will clean it up.

### Code needed:

* Tridents: mc_tridents (Minetest-j45)

## Textures

I'd like for the textures to be as close to Minecraft's textures as possible.

### Textures needed:

* Tridents: mc_tridents
* Ancient Debris: mc_netherite
* Netherite Scrap: mc_netherite
* Block of Netherite: mc_netherite (improvement)
* Scaffolding: mc_scaffolding

## Models

I dont plan on making the models for mobs myself, epCode is doing it in his repo extra_mobs on https://git.minetest.land/epCode/extra_mobs, but I do include entities.

### Models needed:

* None at the moment

# TODO List:

* New structures
* Honey (waiting on epCode to make bees)
* ...
